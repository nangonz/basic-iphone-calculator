# Basic Iphone Calculator app - Javascript, HTML, CSS
We're going to build the basic iPhone calculator to put our JavaScript skills to the test. 
To get started, create an HTML file, a CSS file, and then a JavaScript file.  
Our calculator is basically an HTML form with a lot of buttons and an input field.  
To style it, we're gonna use CSS so that it resembles the calculator on iPhones.
